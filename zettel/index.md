Cyberpunk 1997
==============

A _Cyberpunk 2077_ demake.

Gameplay
--------

You wander a procedurally generated cyberpunk neighborhood, trailing targets, losing trails, and trying to get your rocks off before you leave this mortal coil.

Story
-----

You've done it now. Or maybe you haven't. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you've got corporate goons on your ass, and you'd better fucking deal.
