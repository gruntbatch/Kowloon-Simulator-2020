Libraries
=========

Install the latest Windows binaries for [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) here. Make sure to get the _development_ binaries for SDL2.

After extracting the files, copy their contents here. You should end up with something like this:

    Kowloon/lib/LIBRARIES.md
	Kowloon/lib/glew-2.1.0/bin/...	
	Kowloon/lib/glew-2.1.0/include/...
	Kowloon/lib/glew-2.1.0/lib/...
	Kowloon/lib/SDL2-2.0.12/bin...
    Kowloon/lib/SDL2-2.0.12/include...
	Kowloon/lib/SDL2-2.0.12/lib...
